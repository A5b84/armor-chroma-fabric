# Armor Chroma

This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) port of the original [Armor Chroma](https://github.com/mccreery/armor-chroma) mod by [jobicade], a mod to improve on vanilla's default armor bar.

Features include:
- Different icons depending on the material of equipped items
- Displaying glint for enchanted armor pieces
- Displaying armor points over 20 with additional armor icon rows or with a colored outline
- A minimal config screen accessible through [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) when [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) is installed.

The mod also provides a built-in resource pack by [Andrew Grant] with alternative icons.
