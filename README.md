# Armor Chroma

This is a [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) fork of the original [Armor Chroma](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armor-chroma) mod by [jobicade], a client-side mod to improve on vanilla's default armor bar.

Features include:
- Different icons depending on the material of equipped items
- Displaying glint for enchanted armor pieces
- Displaying armor points over 20 with additional armor icon rows or with a colored outline
- A minimal config screen accessible through [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) when [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) is installed
- Additional icons for supported mods (see [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/armor-chroma), original Fabric mods are not supported yet)
- Optional built-in resource pack by [Andrew Grant] with alternative icons for vanilla materials.
