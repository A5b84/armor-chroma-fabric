*Draconic Evolution (Higher res. armor so icon may be harder)

*Random Things  (Only has One Set of Armor I know of
but It is a popular mod and The Armor normally has transparency
so it would be great if you could make it translucent :)

*Magical Crops(Armor icons should be similar as the armor is normaly to)
